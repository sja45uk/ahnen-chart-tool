README.md for ahnen-chart-tool

This is a WikiTree visual display tool designed to run on the https://apps.wikitree.com/apps/ server, which 
generates an indented format Ahnentafel chart of the ancestors for a selected WikiTree root profile. 
It was started during Hacktoberfest 2022, and development continued but was never completed during 2023, 
because of difficulties with, and changes to, the WikiTree API. 

It is intended to complete enough of its development, during Hactoberfest (October) 2025, 
so that it can be added to the standard set of WikiTree chart tools for testing and comment.

The idea for a novel Ahnen Chart layout was first described on one of my Free Space Pages (FSPs)
https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Ahnen_Chart_View_user_guide during October 2022. Development and
testing was done using tools on a variety of operating system environments (Windows, Ubuntu & Raspberry Pi).  
However, the source code was never added to the https://GitHub.com/sja45uk/ahnen-chart-tool repository.
Instead, each version of the main source file was given a simple combination of a version letter and number  
to identify its revision history, and multiple copies were installed on https://apps.wikitree.com/apps/adey271/
as various ahnenChart*.js variants. 

This 2025 project will be the first time that an attempt is made to better track the code development.
