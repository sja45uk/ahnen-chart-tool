README.md for ahnen-chart-tool
This is a WikiTree visual display tool designed to run on the https://apps.wikitree.com server, and generate an indented format Ahnentafel chart of the ancestors of a selected WikiTree profile. It was started during Hacktoberfest 2022 and never completed because of difficulties with, and changes to,  the WikiTree API. It is intended to complete enough of its development, during Hactoberfest 2025, so that it can be added to the standard set of WikiTree chart tools for testing and comment.
